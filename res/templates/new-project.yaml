# I see you're creating a new project!
# 
# This is the "init" file. It uses YAML syntax:
# https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML . This file will be used to create the
# .decamp/project.json file.
# 
# This is a comment. Lines starting with '#' will be ignored. Likewise, you can
# do stuff like this:
# 
# foo: bar  # this here is also ignored.
# 
# If you have a # in the middle of some text, you should put quotations around
# the text if you don't want the stuff following the # to be ignored:
# 
# foo: "bar  # this is no longer ignored."

name: null
# This is the name of the project. It will default to the name of your working
# directory if you leave it as null.
# 
# If the name uses any weird characters, you should surround it with quotations.
# 
# This is okay: 
# 
# name: my-project
# 
# This might give you some trouble though:
# 
# name: my:project
# 
# The ':' has a special meaning in YAML, so the parser might get
# confused. Instead, do this:
# 
# name: "my:project"
# 

description: null
# This is an optional description of your project
# 
# If it's a long description, you can use this syntax:
# 
# description: >-
#   Your description goes here.
# 
#   You can keep going down here.
# 
# If it's a short (one line) description, then this would probably be better:
#  
# description: "my description"
# 

homepage: null
# This is the homepage of your project. You should probably surround it with
# quotation marks. That is, this entry should read
# 
# homepage: "http://mysite.com/foo/bar/baz"
# 
# instead of
# 
# homepage: http://mysite.com/foo/bar/baz
# 

maintainer: null
# This is the information for the project maintainer. If the maintainer is
# anonymous, you can leave this blank. I haven't yet written support for
# multiple maintainers, so just pick the most important one.
# 
# By default, this is null. However, if you want to add a maintainer, it should
# look like this:
# 
# maintainer:
#   name: Peter Harpending
#   email: "peter@harpending.org"
# 
# My YAML parser will get angry if you try to do 
# 
# maintainer: "Peter Harpending <peter@harpending.org>"
